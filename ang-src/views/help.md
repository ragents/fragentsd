fragents
================================================================================

fragents is a
[ragents server](https://github.com/ragents/ragents-server),
which can be used to communicate with
[ragents](https://github.com/ragents/ragents),
and has a nice web front end to see all the ragents connected to a session.

The web front end consists of three pages:

- [Sessions](/) - shows sessions attached to, and ragents connected to those
  sessions

- [Messages](/messages) - shows diagnostic messages for the web front end

- Help - this help page


Sessions page
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sessions page shows the sessions you are connected to, and the ragents
connected to that session.

You can click on the "Add Session" button to create a new session on the
server.  This will show up as a new panel under the "Sessions" header,
and show you the connected ragents.  You can disconnect (and forget) the
session by clicking the "x remove" button beside the session URL.



Messages page
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can click the "verbose" check-box to show informational messages, and
click the "Clear" button to clear all the messages.
